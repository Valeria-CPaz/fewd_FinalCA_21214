<h4>.Concept</h4>
<p>My initial concept was to use a sketch theme throughout the page, linking 'hand-made' elements using CSS. But as I decided to use Bootstrap to build my project, 
several initial ideas were changed on trying to keep the use of Bootstrap.</p>
<p>As using Boostrap is a new experience to me, I tried to focus on responsiveness without forgetting to add a few JavaScript details. </p>

<h4>.Colour</h4>
<p>Using the theme colours in Bootstrap is by far the easiest way to manipulate the layout, so that's what I did. Which explains why I ended up with a not so common primary 
colour choice, yellow. 'Warning' was my theme choice, after trying 'danger' and 'info' and not being very pleased.</p>

<h4>.Problems</h4>
<p>I haven't encounter many problemas using Bootstrap 5 as the documentation is very good and the amount of tutorials on the internet is amazing. 
All extra manual CSS code that I've decided to include have worked fine. <br>
The only problem I had was a silly mistake of inserting the data between the wrong "><". But Erika saved me S2.</p>

<h4>.Testing</h4>
<p>I had two people testing my Webpage. One in a smartphone and the other in a tablet. Both have worked fine, which makes me very happy,</p

<h4>.Conclusion</h4>
<p>I would love to play a bit more around colours using Bootstrap as this was the main chain I have encounter on trying to personalized my Bootstrap contents./p>
